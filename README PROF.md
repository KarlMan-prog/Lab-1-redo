# Lab-1-redo

Just for the record, if anything isn't looking good on my repository.

I have no idea what I'm doing with GitKraken and GitHub.

For example, I cannot commmit changes on my GitKraken (The button doesn't show up like in your tutorial) and I'm not sure how to 
pull that to GitHub.

Also, in my Repo I have added a bunch of stuff and it looks messy, and I'm unsure how to fix it.

I might start from scratch after you mark my Lab 1, because I'm scared I will break it.
